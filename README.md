This is my first Umbraco website that i have been requested to make by Arkom Creative Technology. I have created the website using Umbraco CMS with Razor Pages. 
I made a contact form that uses a Surface Controller, an SMTP service and Google reCAPTCHA. 
Then I made a database that used Umbraco databases, and have rendered it using a Render Controller and then added CRUD functions to the database so new members can be added, deleted and updated in the database.
